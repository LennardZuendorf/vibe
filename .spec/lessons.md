# Lessons

Mistakes made and rules to prevent repeating them. Written during `compound`,
read on entry to `*.design` and `*.triage` so past mistakes shape new work.
Tags make entries retrievable — scan for tags matching the work in hand.

### Spec strictness: warn-first, then migrate
**Pattern:** New validate.sh checks shipped as errors immediately; dogfood repo's legacy feature plans failed validation before migration, blocking the harness from validating itself.
**Rule:** Ship structural validators warn-first; promote warn→error only after live specs are migrated during compound. Pair every validator with a behaviour test in `tests/spec/run.sh`.
