# Frozen oracles

Byte-exact copies of the implementation the Rust port must match (D30, F3):

- `bash/` — every tracked script under `spec/scripts/`, `flow/scripts/`,
  `flow/hooks-fallback/` and `.claude/hooks/`, at its repo path, plus the
  four setup templates `spec/scripts/setup.sh` reads.
- `js/` — every non-test module of `flow/engine/`.

`MANIFEST.sha256` lists every file; `bash oracles/check.sh` fails on any
byte change, missing or unlisted file, or fewer files than its floor. An
oracle never changes to match a bug: a defect found during parity becomes an
`expected-divergence` pin in the parity suite, fixed in Rust only.

Frozen from commit 4e52d07bf34c391f5b5f8f5183aae1b8fdc1113f.
