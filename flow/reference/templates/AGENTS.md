This project runs the **vibe flow** — a spec-first workflow harness. `.spec/` is the
durable memory; sessions are ephemeral. Read the specs before you write code.

## Session start

1. Read `.spec/lessons.md` and `.spec/plan.md`.
2. Identify the feature you are working on and load its specs:
   `.spec/features/<name>/{product,tech,plan}.md`.
3. If `.agents/skills/vibe/state.json` exists and you are continuing a flow session,
   read `{flow, phase, feature}` and resume the linked `vibe` skill. A missing cursor
   means `idle` — proceed with the specs; a missing cursor is not an error.

## Driving the flow

- `/flow <flow.phase> [feature] [confirm]` transitions the state machine. Pass the feature
  name to carry it into the cursor; add the literal `confirm` token to cross a gated edge
  (the two human gates below). Never edit `state.json` by hand.
- Under the hood `/flow` runs
  `bash .agents/skills/vibe/scripts/set-state.sh <flow.phase> [feature]`. That script is a
  *writer*, not a gate — it moves the cursor but enforces no approval. The gate teeth live
  in the `/flow` command and the hooks, not the writer.
- Per-turn **orders** for the current state come from the linked `vibe` skill, resolved by
  `orders.sh`. Follow the current state's orders over any delegated skill's own prose.

## Working model

```
ASK → read .spec/ → PLAN → CONFIRM → IMPL → verify → compound
```

Most transitions auto-advance. Two edges are **human gates** — stop and get explicit
approval before crossing: plan → impl, and verify → ship. Everything else flows without
pausing to ask.

## Write invariants

Policy lives in `detect-context.sh decide` (defaults to `idle` when `state.json` is absent):

1. `.spec/lessons.md` — writable only in `feature.compound`, `setup.apply`, `strategy.spec`,
   or `quick.verify` (the flow-end states that carry the lesson step; or when explicitly
   recording a lesson with user approval).
2. Root `.spec/{product,tech,design,plan}.md` — only in `strategy.spec`, `feature.compound`,
   or `setup.apply`.
3. `.agents/skills/vibe/state.json` — only via `set-state.sh`.

Everything else is allow/warn. Check before writing:

```bash
bash .agents/skills/vibe/scripts/detect-context.sh decide <path>
```

## Precedence

The cursor owns sequencing and artifact destinations; delegated skills own method. When a
delegated skill's text names its own artifact path or hands off elsewhere, the current
state's orders win: write to the state's surface, transition only via `set-state.sh`. Scope
edits are not a state — edit within the current state's write surface and stay put.
`set-state.sh idle` is always legal: abort ends any flow.

## Commands

```bash
# Spec validation — run before claiming done
bash .agents/skills/spec/scripts/validate.sh
# Write policy for a path (works without state.json)
bash .agents/skills/vibe/scripts/detect-context.sh decide <path>
# Health-check the harness wiring (hooks, cursor, machine)
bash .agents/skills/vibe/scripts/doctor.sh
```

## Enforcement is partial — do not trust it blindly

- The `pre-tool-use-guard` hook only intercepts `Edit`, `Write`, and `NotebookEdit` tool
  calls. Shell redirection (`>`, `tee`, `sed -i`) bypasses it — honoring the write
  invariants there is a **convention**, backed only by a warn-only Bash sniffer.
- `set-state.sh` writes the cursor; it does not gate. Approvals are enforced by `/flow` and
  the hooks, not by the writer.
- The Stop receipt tooth (a `*.verify` state needs a fresh evidence receipt) fires only when
  the hooks are wired into the platform (e.g. `.claude/settings.json`). No wiring, no tooth.

## Degrade

Scripts graceful-degrade: `jq` is recommended but optional (a pure-bash path keeps the
cursor byte-identical), and other agents may edit concurrently — touch only your own files
and prefer warn over hard-fail.
