# vibe — workflow router

One skill for the whole vibe flow. This lean entry carries the routing table and
the machine-extractable per-turn orders; each phase file holds the full procedure.
Read the phase file for your current (or target) state, then follow it.

## Routing

| Argument | Phase file | States |
|---|---|---|
| `setup` | [setup.md](setup.md) | `setup.detect`, `setup.apply` |
| `strategy` | [strategy.md](strategy.md) | `strategy.brainstorm`, `strategy.spec` |
| `feature` | [feature.md](feature.md) | `feature.design`, `feature.plan`, `feature.impl` |
| `quick` | [quick.md](quick.md) | `quick.triage`, `quick.fix`, `quick.verify` |
| `verify` | [verify.md](verify.md) | `feature.verify`, `quick.verify` |
| `compound` | [compound.md](compound.md) | `feature.compound` |

`scripts/` and `reference/` back the setup phase: `merge-agents.sh`, the `AGENTS.md`
template, and `adapters.json`.

## Style

Output density is governed by one machine-level note (`style` in
[state-machine.json](state-machine.json)), not a per-state level: no filler or
hedging, compress receipts and subagent summaries, but security warnings and
irreversible-action confirmations always stay in full prose, and compression
never reduces reasoning depth — code, paths, and commands stay byte-exact.

## Precedence

The cursor owns sequencing and artifact destinations; delegates own method.
When a delegated skill's text names its own artifact path, commits its own
output, or hands off to another skill, the current state's orders win: write
to the state's surface, leave commits to the flow, transition only via
`set-state.sh`. Scope edits are not a state: edit within the current state's
write surface and stay put. `set-state.sh idle` is always legal — abort ends
any flow.

The two gated edges (`feature.plan>feature.impl`, `feature.verify>feature.compound`
in the machine's `gates`) stop and ask. Via the `/flow` command they apply only
with an explicit `confirm` token in the same message (e.g. `/flow feature.impl
confirm`); without it the command stops and asks. `/flow idle` is never gated.

## Orders (D12)

Machine-extractable per-state orders. The `UserPromptSubmit` inject hook resolves
the current `<flow>.<phase>`, follows its `skill` link (now always `vibe`), and emits
the matching block verbatim via `.agents/skills/vibe/scripts/orders.sh`. `<feature>` is the
only interpolation; keep each block byte-stable.
